Welcome to the keyboard shortcuts workshop!
We will mostly focus on using the keyboard effectively, with a few mouse tricks
thrown in as well.

The mouse is a great tool, and when it makes sense to use the mouse in your work,
use
it.  Likewise, the keyboard is powerful.  You can only use one at a time, and it is
inefficient to switch between the mouse and the keyboard too often.  When you are in
the middle of typing, it is slow and distracting to grab the mouse to move the cursor
a short distance or to cut, copy and paste small distances or repetitively.  Let's
practice using the keyboard to get around.  Throughout this tutorial, use only the
keyboard unless specifically told to use the mouse.

*** Common Commands

** Moving the cursor

We'll start with the arrow keys.  You know what they do, but let's get used to using
them.  We'll see where they are useful and where they are slow and cumbersome.  Then
you'll learn ways to speed them up.  Hopefully you will get to where moving around in
a file using the keyboard is second nature.

We'll use the following exercise paragraph a lot.  Soon you will know exactly what
to
edit and will keep learning faster ways to do it.

* Exercise:
Using only the arrow keys to move around and the backspace key to erase, change
"problem" to "correction" and "bad" to "good" in the following sentences.  

    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.

You probably noticed that moving up and down isn't too bad, but moving left and right
can be pretty slow.  Using the Control key you can make the two arrow keys move the
cursor one word at a time.  The Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right key combinations work in
almost any programs on any operating system.  Try it now.  It's important to
recognize that Control is a *modifier key* like the Shift key is.  As long as you
hold it down, it modifies the behavior of other keys.  That means that if you hold
down Control, you can jump over several words by pressing Left or Right repeatedly. 
Use this technique to move to the front and end of your current line.

* Exercise:
Using only the Ctrl-Left and Ctrl-Right combinations to move around and the backspace
key to erase, change "problem" to "correction" and "bad" to "good" in the following
sentences.  

    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.

Alright, let's move a little faster.  The Control key also makes the Backspace and
Delete key operate on words.

* Exercise:
Using Ctrl-Left/Right and Ctrl-Bksp/Del, change "problem" to "correction" and "bad"
to "good" in the following sentences.  

    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.

Now get used to using the Home and End keys.  Hopefully your fingers will learn to
find them without looking.

* Exercise:
Using Ctrl-Left/Right, Ctrl-Bksp/Del, Home/End, change "problem" to "correction"
and
"bad" to "good" in the following sentences.  

    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.

The Control key works with Home and End too.  The go to the beginning and end of
the
whole file.

* Exercise:
Take note of what line number this is.  You may use the mouse to return here after this 
exercise.

Use Ctrl-Home to go to the top and put your name after "Welcome".
Use Ctrl-End to add "The End" to the bottom.

** Selecting text

All of the shortcuts so far can be used to select text.  Once the text is selected,
you can erase it with Backspace or Delete.  You don't have to delete the selection
before typing something else.  As soon as you start typing the selection will
disappear and be replaced with what you type.

* Exercise:
Use Left/Right/Up/Down, Home/End
    Ctrl Left/Right
    Shift-Up/Down
    Shift-Ctrl Left/Right
Do not use: Backspace/Delete!
Change "problem" to "correction" and "bad" to "good" in the following sentences.


    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.  If you didn't use all of the keys/combinations, take
    care of the problem.  Once you have used all of them, that is bad.  Oops, there is a
    problem in the previous sentence!

* Exercise:
Use Shift-Home/End
    Shift-Bksp/Del
Change "problem" to "correction" and "bad" to "good" in the following sentences.

Then replace the last line with "Done!"
    This is a paragraph with problems.  There is a problem in this sentence.  There's
    another problem in this sentence.  This sentence is bad.  This one is really bad. 
    Here come some more sentences with problems.  There's a bad boy who is always making
    problems where things go wrong.  If you didn't use all of the keys/combinations, take
    care of the problem.  
    Once you have used all of them, that is bad.  Oops, there is a problem in the
    previous sentence!  Get rid of this line.

** Editing

You may be familiar with these; let's practice them:
Ctrl-C/X/V - Copy/Cut/Paste

* Exercise:
Use Ctrl-X to cut these sentences.  Then use Ctrl-V to paste them twice.
    This is a paragraph with corrections.  There is a correction in this sentence.
  
    There's another correction in this sentence.  This sentence is good.  This one is
    really good.  Here come some more sentences with corrections.  There's a good boy who
    is always making corrections where things go wrong.

* Exercise:
Use Ctrl-C to copy these sentences.  While they are still highlighted, hold down
Control and press V three times.  You should now have three copies
    This is a paragraph with corrections.  There is a correction in this sentence.
  
    There's another correction in this sentence.  This sentence is good.  This one is
    really good.  Here come some more sentences with corrections.  There's a good boy who
    is always making corrections where things go wrong.

* Exercise:
Hold down Control and press Z a few times.  Hold down Control and press Y repeatedly
until all changes have been restored.
    This is a paragraph with corrections.  There is a correction in this sentence.
  
    There's another correction in this sentence.  This sentence is good.  This one is
    really good.  Here come some more sentences with corrections.  There's a good boy who
    is always making corrections where things go wrong.

This is the end of the section on common shortcuts.  All of these are available in
almost all programs and operating systems.
